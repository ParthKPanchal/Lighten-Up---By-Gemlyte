          <p><strong>Lighten Up</strong> believes in helping its customers as far as possible, and has therefore a liberal cancellation policy. Under this policy:</p>

          <p>Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made immediately after placing the order. However, if the order is already in the shipping process, cancellation may not be accepted. Perishable items like flowers, food, etc., are not eligible for cancellation. Refunds/replacements may apply if the delivered product is faulty.</p>

          <h5 class="mt-4">Refund Policy</h5>
          <p>Report damaged or defective items within 7 days of receipt to Customer Service. We’ll evaluate the claim before accepting it. If the item doesn’t match expectations, you must notify our team within 7 days, and we will assess the issue accordingly.</p>

          <p>For manufacturer-warranty products, contact the manufacturer directly. If <strong>Lighten Up</strong> approves a refund, it will be processed within 9–15 working days.</p>

          <p>If you have any questions about this policy, feel free to reach out — we’re here to help.</p>
